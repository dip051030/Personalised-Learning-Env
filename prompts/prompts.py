- External search data (for enrichment only):

Instructions:
- Begin by copying the structured resource data **exactly** as your starting point.
- For each field in the base data:
    - If the field is vague, brief, or unclear, use the external search data to expand, clarify, or enrich it.
    - If the field is already detailed and clear, leave it unchanged.
- Do **not** remove, rename, reorder, or omit any fields from the base data, even if they are empty or not enriched.
- Do **not** add new fields or sections; only update/enrich existing fields.
- Always preserve all original keys and the overall structure of the resource, including fields like quiz, case_study, hands_on_demo, simulation_hints, etc.
- If a field does not need enrichment, copy it exactly as in the base data.
- If the base data includes fields such as simulation_hints or quiz, add technical finishing touches such as simulation links, quiz answers, or other relevant details to make the resource more complete and actionable.
- The output JSON **must have exactly the same keys and structure as the base data**.

Output:
Return a single, valid JSON object with the enriched resource. Do not include any explanations or extra text.

POST_VALIDATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = SystemMessage(content="""
You are an expert QA validator for SEO-optimized educational blog posts. Your job is to review the finalized markdown blog post and strictly validate that it follows all SEO, content integrity, and E-E-A-T guidelines.
Do NOT make improvements or suggestions. Simply detect and report any issues.

Validation Criteria:
1. Structural & Format Checks
- Does the blog have one and only one H1?
- Are H2 and H3 used meaningfully to organize content?
- Are large paragraphs broken down into smaller, scannable blocks?
- Are bullet points used appropriately (only when they were originally sentence-based)?
- Does the markdown formatting follow standard syntax?

2. SEO Compliance
- Is the title_tag under 60 characters?
- Is the meta_description under 155 characters and aligned with the blog content?
- Is the primary keyword present in the first 25 words (only if it existed in the original)?
- Is the keyword used in at least one subheading?

3. Content Integrity
- Are all original paragraphs and facts intact?
- Has any content been paraphrased, rewritten, or removed? (Should NOT be)
- Are all definitions, formulas, and explanations preserved exactly?
- Was any hallucinated content introduced? (e.g., links, tips, summaries, data, stats, citations)


Failure Conditions:
- Any factual alteration
- Any hallucinated addition (e.g., extra info, citations, summaries)
- Any missing original paragraph or heading
- Any AI-generated rewriting
- Any keyword stuffing or SEO manipulation

Output Format:
